PROJECT: Hungry Helper Los Angeles

SUMMARY: 

This is an app that uses the Zomato API to help users based in the Los Angeles, California area find suggested places to eat.

A user can submit a query and will be given 5 locations by the Zomato API. 
Each location has the name of the establishment, the type of cuisine served, address information, and Zomato ratings.

The ratings are based on a high score between 1.0-5.0, with 5.0 being the highest and 1.0 being the lowest. 

Each rating also is accompanied by a rating of Excellent, Very Good, Good, and None for establishments without enough information for a rating.
